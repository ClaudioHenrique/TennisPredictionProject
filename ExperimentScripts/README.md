Summary of Experiments. Note experiments were run on a machine with 40 cores.

### Experiment 1
Explores a standard exponential decay function for weighting past matches in a Bradley-Terry model based on combined point and game level information.

### Experiment 2
Explores an alternative form of weighting function. Again in a Bradley-Terry model based on combined point and game level information.

### Experiment 3
Explores L2 regularisation in a Bradley-Terry model based on combined point and game level information.

### Experiment 4
Explores Free Parameter models with and without bias terms, based on point level information and also combined point and game information. 

### Experiment 5
Explores L2 regularisation in a Free Parameter model based on combined point and game level information. 

### Experiment 6
Evaluates a joint optimisation time series Bradley-Terry model based on combined point and game level information.

### Experiment 7
Explores different filtered times series Bradley-Terry model based on, point, game, match and combined point and game level information.

### Experiment 8
Explores a filtered times series version of the Free Parameter model based on combined point and game level information.

### Experiment 9
Explores surface factor models with 2 and 3 factors for random intialisations and hand picked initialisations.

### Experiment 10
Explores regularisation in a surface factor model with 2 factors and hand picked initialisation.
